    <h2>Return & Exchange Policy</h2>

    <p>
    Please note that in case of a return or exchange, the policy mentioned below will be followed.
  </p>

  <h3>Can the product be exchanged or replaced?</h3>
  <p>
    We can issue a replacement in case you receive a product that is damaged or defective.
    In such a case, you need to inform us within 7 days of receiving the product at our email address
    <a href="mailto:support@invogue.shop">support@invogue.shop</a>
    or raise an exchange request via our exchange portal.
  </p>

  <h3>I want to get a replacement, how do I get it?</h3>
  <p>
    In order to get a replacement, please write to us at
    <a href="mailto:support@invogue.shop">support@invogue.shop</a>
    and mention your order number along with the reason for the replacement.
    Our team will review the request and issue a replacement within 24–48 hours.
    Alternatively, you may raise an exchange request via our exchange portal.
  </p>

  <h3>The product doesn’t fit me properly. I want a different size!</h3>
  <p>
    Simply email us your order ID and the size you want to be replaced, and we will get back to you with further instructions.
    Alternatively, you may raise an exchange request via our exchange portal.
  </p>

  <p>
    In case of any other issues or queries, please email us at
    <a href="mailto:support@invogue.shop">support@invogue.shop</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the requested size is out of stock, the customer must return the original item and wait for restock to receive the exchanged size.
  </p>

  <h3>Exchange Process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      For an exchange, the delivery partner charges us for reverse pickup and re-delivery.
      Since these are two-way charges, customers are requested to pay a one-way charge of ₹100.
      This amount will be credited back to the customer’s store wallet after product quality check
      (timeline: 3–7 working days).
    </li>
    <li>
      This fee must be paid at the time of raising an exchange request.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the fee is paid, the exchange request is reviewed and approved based on the provided details.
    </li>
    <li>
      After approval, a pickup for the exchanged item will be scheduled.
    </li>
    <li>
      If reverse pickup is not possible due to non-serviceable pincode, the customer must ship the product back.
      Any exchange charges paid will be refunded in such cases.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the exchanged item reaches us, we will dispatch the replacement item.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>
    Since the products are non-returnable, no refunds will be made. However, in special circumstances
    (such as change in variant, color, or product), refunds will be provided in the form of a discount code
    of the same value. The standard timeline for such refunds is 3–7 working days.
  </p>

  <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Once an order is placed, it cannot be cancelled. This is because we import our products internationally,
    and customs fees and taxes are immediately charged upon order confirmation. These fees are non-refundable,
    and we are unable to absorb the cost of cancelling orders.
